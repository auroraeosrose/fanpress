            This website uses an application system to accept new authors into the library.
            This system is merit based, meaning anyone who meet the requirements will be able to
            become an author, it is not based on who you know or who you are.  The current requirements
            for an author account involve filling out the form below, and submitting a 500 word or larger
            sample of your writing.  This sample can be about anything related to Sailor Moon - it does NOT have
            to be a Shitennou and Senshi story, and can be anything from a historical romance to a canon tale.  Since
            this sample will be stored along with your author profile, it needs to be appropriate for
            all readers.  Good spelling and grammar are a must, and although it may be part of a larger
            story, remember it will be archived and readable permanently so a stand alone story or vingnette
            is preferable.  After you submit your application one of the site editors will review it and send
            an acceptance or rejection email.  So make sure that the email address you use when applying is
            accessible.  If your application is rejected, the editor will include specific instructions
            for what needs to be improved and/or fixed in your story and your current application will be deleted.
            If your application is accepted, you will be granted immediate access to your author account.
